# loop_enum

## Overview
`loop_enum` is a foundational library for generating character combinations. It employs a straightforward approach based on nested loops to sequentially generate all possible combinations of a given length from a set of characters.

## Purpose
This library serves as a baseline comparison for more optimized combination generation algorithms. Its simplicity and directness provide a clear understanding of the generation process and serve as an excellent introduction for those wanting to delve deeper into the problem.

## Notes
While `loop_enum` is efficient for smaller datasets, it can be inefficient for larger character sets or longer combinations due to its linear approach. It's recommended to use more optimized methods for larger data scenarios.
